Plastic Logic SDK - NDK Builder instructions

1. Prerequesites

In order to build for an Android target you need to download and install
the Android NDK toolset. This can be downloaded from:

http://developer.android.com/tools/sdk/ndk/index.html

By default it will install in /opt/android-ndk-<version>

2. Adjust environment variables

Once installed the only setup required is to add the NDK installation folder
to the path.

Modify the envsetup.sh script to append the NDK location to the PATH for
future use.

There is no default value as the NDK installation location cannot be predicted.


3. Build

To build the SDK using the NDK Builder execute the following commands
from the build_android-ndk directory:

. /jni/envsetup.sh
ndk-build

The compiled binary files are located in the following directory:

Top-level output directory: libs/$ABI/
For example: ./libs/armeabi/

4. Installing the SDK on a target system

The SDK files required on a target system are:
    - All the applications and shared libraries from the “libs/$ABI” directory

The shared libraries must be copied to a standard library directory
(/lib or /usr/lib), or the applications will not be able find the libraries
automatically.


To test the SDK is installed correctly, navigate to the directory where the
applications have been copied and type:
# ./eptest
If the SDK is installed correctly then this will update the display.  If not,
check that the output of the eptest application reports the correct e-paper
mode and description.  If the mode is reported as “noep” then the application
has not found the correct library for the target platform.  Check that the
shared libraries have been copied to the target platform and are
in a standard library directory.
